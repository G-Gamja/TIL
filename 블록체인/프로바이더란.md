# 프로바이더, Provider

Provider is a computer node that acts as an interface for applications to access the underlying blockchain protocols. The Provider interacts with the blockchain to provide access to the underlying data and services, including sending transactions, querying the chain state, and much more. Depending on the specific blockchain protocol, these nodes may act as miners, full-nodes, or both. Providers are generally integrated as a crucial component of an application’s infrastructure, allowing the application to interact with the blockchain and its users.
