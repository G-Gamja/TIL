# EIP-6963: Support for EIP-6963 in Wallets

# 디앱 - 지갑 연결 플로우

1. The dApp requests providers: The dApp broadcasts the eip6963:requestProvider event, essentially informing all installed wallets that a user wants to connect.

2. Wallet extensions respond to the request: Upon receiving this event, each wallet extension responds by broadcasting an eip6963:announceProvider event with its provider and details as a payload. These details include the wallet’s name, logo, unique identifiers, and Reverse Domain Name Service (RDNS). This richer data enables dApps to display clear wallet options to the user and tailor the experience accordingly.

3. The dApp builds a list of available wallets from the responses: The dApp receives information from responding wallets and builds a list of available wallet options for the user to connect with.
