스팩 설명

Describe the feature
EIP 2930 adds a transaction type which contains a list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction plans to access, AKA Access List.

All slots in the list are paid in advance, at a discount relative to the cost of accessing those not in the list.
Of course, any slot specified in the list but not accessed during the transaction, will be "paid for nothing".

An example of a transaction which specifies an access list:

const tx = {
from: walletAddress,
to: contractAddress,
data: transactionData,
value: 0,
type: 1,
accessList: [
{
address: contractAddress,
storageKeys: [
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042",
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000053",
],
},
{
address: usdcTokenAddress,
storageKeys: [
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
],
},
],
};
The primary difficulty is of course computing the access-list for a specific transaction in advance, as there may be several different contracts involved in the transaction, and in each one of them, different storage slots may be accessed depending on the specific details of the transaction.

Luckily, the Go-Ethereum (GETH) client supports the eth_createAccessList RPC method for conveniently determining the list of all storage slots expected to be accessed during a given transaction.

You can find an example of this in web3.js.
I'm not sure whether or not ethers.js (which HardHat relies on as its Web3 backbone) supports this method as well.
