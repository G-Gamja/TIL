# EIP-2612: permit – 712-signed approvals

- EIP: 2612
- Title: permit – 712-signed approvals

## Simple Summary

ERC-20 token can be approved by a signature from the owner.

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new function `permit` that allows token holders to delegate their right to transfer tokens to a specific third party. This is done by signing a message that contains the delegation data. The signature is then verified by the smart contract to approve the transfer.

## Motivation

The current ERC-20 standard requires two transactions to approve and transfer tokens. This EIP aims to reduce the number of transactions required to approve and transfer tokens.

## Specification

The `permit` function is defined as follows:

```solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external;
```

- `owner`: The owner of the tokens
- `spender`: The address that is approved to spend the tokens
- `value`: The amount of tokens that are approved to be spent
- `deadline`: The deadline by which the signature must be submitted
- `v`, `r`, `s`: The signature data

The `permit` function allows the owner to sign a message that contains the delegation data. The signature is then verified by the smart contract to approve the transfer.

## Rationale

The `permit` function allows token holders to delegate their right to transfer tokens to a specific third party without requiring two transactions. This reduces the number of transactions required to approve and transfer tokens, which can help reduce gas costs and improve the user experience.

## Backwards Compatibility

The `permit` function is an addition to the ERC-20 standard and does not affect existing ERC-20 functions. Existing ERC-20 tokens can choose to implement the `permit` function to provide additional functionality to their users.

## Test Cases

The `permit` function can be tested by signing a message with the delegation data and verifying that the signature is accepted by the smart contract.

## Implementation

The `permit` function can be implemented in ERC-20 tokens by adding the `permit` function to the token contract and verifying the signature in the function.

## Security Considerations

The `permit` function should be implemented carefully to ensure that the signature verification is secure and cannot be bypassed by malicious actors. The function should also include checks to prevent replay attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
