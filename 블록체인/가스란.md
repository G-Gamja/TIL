* 가스 wanted란
when you set the gas wanted, is the max you want to spend. The gas used is what you effectively paid for the transaction

## Gas Limit
유저가 tx를 날리거나 스마트컨트랙을 사용할때 지불될 수 있는 가스비의 최대 한도값

그니까 내가 익스텐션 내 150000이라고 정의해놓은거는 내가 최대 이만큼 가스를 낼 수 있다를 정의해준거고 - gas wanted
실제 사용된 가스량은 이러하다 - gas used

Gas (used / wanted) 
100,129 / 100,000   
이런식이면 나는 100,000을 낸다고 했는데 실제로 필요한 값은 100,129니까 가스비 부족하다고 멤풀에서 뱉어내는 거임

그리고 가스 리밋보다 적게 노드가 사용했다면(Gas Used)남는 수수료는 환불된다.

## 가스 계산식
* 이더리움
    gasLimit = G(transaction) + G(txdatanonzero) × dataByteLength

Gas limit defines the maximum amount of gas an operation can use. For example, when sending some Ether from Alice to Bob, the gas limit is usually set at a standard of 21000, assuming no more data is included in the transaction. 21000 is the minimum amount of gas an operation on Ethereum will use. This limit is used to guarantee that the transaction will be executed. The limit is usually provided by the clients/wallets, which estimate the maximum boundary for gas use of an operation, to assure that it will be executed properly without the user having to worry. In this case, the unused Ether used to pay for the extra gas will be returned to your account if the operation uses less gas than the limit. While many times the limit is set for you, it can also be set manually, in which case the user runs the risk of the operation failing, if the limit is not enough.

 fees are calculated in gas unit, and the gas limit defines the maximum value that the transaction or function can "charge" or take from the user.
